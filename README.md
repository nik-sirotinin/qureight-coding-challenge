# Qureight Coding Challenge

The machine learning team have made the world’s most powerful cat classifier, but it’s
not quite ready yet. They tell you it takes around *60 seconds* to confirm if a JPEG
image sent to a server is a cat.

You have been tasked with making a simple frontend web application that allows a user to
upload a single image to an `/isthisacat` endpoint. The API is not ready yet, so you
will need to build a simple mock REST API for it.

A very high value client wants to see a demo of how this might work, and the Head of
Quality is expecting a robust and reliable system.

## Constraints

- App should make use of React
- Use a UI library of your choice
- Task should be completed in 2 hours or less
- Use this repository as a template for your app
